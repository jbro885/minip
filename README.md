# Mini P
Mini P (german abbr for Mini Pizza) is a very basics you needed to replicate
with a CouchDB. Its not something you would consider using in production in any
way. Mini P is a playground, a learning project created mostly for myself.

Mini P provides two adapters by now:

* MemoryP - in memory store
* HttpP - talks to a real CouchDB

The api is nothing but the methods needed for replication:

* `allDocs(options)`
* `bulkDocs(docs, options)`
* `bulkGet(docs, options)`

API is a subset of CouchDB's API which is the absolute essential for
replication. It's aligned to CouchDB API as near as possible.

For `bulkDocs` you can pass `{ new_edits: false }` to circumvent new revision
assignment.

For `bulkGet` you pass `{ revs: true }` and get the rev tree.

For `allDocs` and `bulkGet` you pass `{ conflicts: true }` and get the conflicts.

Mini P will not save you from anything. There is exactly zero error handling.
And there is zero beautification. But what comes - who knows?

You get a `replicate(source, target)` API, which replicates an entire database.

Mini P requires Node v8.

## State of Mini P
### What Works
* Store and retrieve a bunch of docs
* Store docs with `new_edits: false`.
* Get docs with `revs: true`
* Update a doc, increment `_rev`
* choose winning rev
* replicating a whole database

### What does not work
Everything else.

No changes feed atm. No views. Almost no error handling. No rev tree merge. No
deletes. No checkpointing.

## Development
The development process is pretty straight forward:
* Write a test and works with HttpP break MemoryP
* Fix MemoryP

### Tests
Additionaly to `npm test` a `npm run test:perf` task provides you with some
numbers for throughput.

All tests run against all adapters. Replication is tested across all adapter
combinations.
