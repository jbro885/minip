# MiniP
MiniP is a very basics you needed to replicate with a CouchDB.

Back in the days when we were young we used to hangout all nights long at a
place we called Schlemmerdreieck, a place with several fast food direct at
U-Schlesisches Tor, in Berlin Kreuzberg.
We watched the beginning of the new age, followed the crowds passing by with
our eyes. And we consumed masses of MiniP (Minipizza) while drinking beer.
Those were the times of us being young, the world was open, we were 20 forever
and thought we could do everything.

Lately I felt a bit the same - like over mighty powers. And sat down and wrote
a little Couch.
